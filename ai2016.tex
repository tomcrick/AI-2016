\abstract{Understanding user behaviour under varying conditions,
scenarios and journeys is fundamental to the improvement of the
user-experience for a given system. Predictive models of user
reactions and responses can aid in the design of more intuitive and
usable systems. The research presented in this paper correlates events
and interactions in an online social network against user behaviour,
focusing on personality traits. Emotional context and tone is analysed
and modelled based on varying types of sentiments that users express
in their language using the IBM Watson Developer Cloud tools. The data
collected in this study thus provides further significant evidence
towards supporting the hypothesis that analysing and modelling
emotions, sentiments and personality traits provides valuable insight
into improving the user experience of complex social computer
systems.}

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

As computer system applications become more complex, with more complex
demands of ever more intuitive human-application interaction, research
in predicting and understanding user behaviour, applied to particular
systems becomes ever more important, impacting elements of daily
societal life, both professionally and personally. Understanding user
behavior, during particular events, leads to a more informed
predictive model, thus allowing the construction of more intuitive
interfaces and a better user experience. Our work, based on
psycholinguistics science, aims to understand whether the words we use
in our daily life reflect our personalities and what we
fell. Psycholinguistics is a well established and active research
field, and it widely accepted that written text can reflect more than
words, it conveys emotion and personality traits.

In this paper the IBM Watson tone analyzer have been used to identify
emotion tones in the text, the research in this area has shown a
strong correlation between the word choice and personality, emotions,
attitude and thought process. This provides further evidence that it
is possible to profile users’ identity Fast and Funder (2008). Most of
the work based on the {\emph{Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count}}
(LIWC) psycholinguistics
dictionary~\citep{pennebaker-et-al:2001,tausczik+pennebaker:2010}.
LIWC is used to find psychologically meaningful word categories from
word usage in writing.

\section{Methodology}\label{method}

\subsection{Dataset}

Social media has been used in varying computer system approaches,
varying from sharing and gathering of information and data, to
catering for marketing and business needs. Furthermore, it is also
used as technical support for computer system
platforms~\citep{thompson:2009}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/socialmediause}
\caption{US consumer preferences for company usage of social media~\citep{thompson:2009}}
\label{fig:socialmediause} 
\end{figure}

According to a survey in 2009~\citep{thompson:2009}, more than 60\%,
agrees with the statement that social media have been used as a
technical support for posting technical issues for computer system
(see Figure~\ref{fig:socialmediause}). Our data set was generated from
interactions between users and complex scholarship system for EU
funds. The whole set consists of 391 users and 1390 comment posted by
users as response to system status and reporting their experience with
the system.

Google Analytics have been installed in the web application to track
user’s behavior and web pages’ impressions, however, the data from
Google analytics have been used to identify the server’s status and
divided the status to two stages idle, where system had higher number
of sessions and system marked as failure where system had a lower
session engaged. As shown in Figure 2, is an screen shot of google
analytic in one day and clearly shows the drop at 8 pm where the
system has been identified as failure.

  24 hour period (timeline during the day vs. number of active sessions)}
\label{fig:googleanalytics} 
\end{figure}

\subsection{Personality Insight}

Big Five personality traits (McCrae and John 175-215, 1992) is one of
the most popular models for generally identify how a person is
responsive in the social life. The model, based on the lexical
hypothesis (Crownie 2007), focuses on five dimensions (Digman, J.M,
1990):

\begin{itemize}
\item {\emph{Agreeableness}} is a person's inclination to be humane
  and helpful toward others;
\item {\emph{Conscientiousness}} is a person's being welling to the
  tasks well and in an efficient organised way;
\item {\emph{Extraversion}} is a person's level of socialisation and
  enjoyment of being around people, the higher value means sociable
  person, lower value means person's rather to be alone;
\item {\emph{Neuroticism}} is a person's level to express some
  negative emotions such as anger and stress.
\item {\emph{Openness}} is the measurement of person's level to try
  new things, adventure, imagination.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Emotion Tones}

The IBM Watson tone analyzer based on Social emotion tones that are being
derived from a research on Emotion Analysis, which is an ensemble
framework to infer emotions from a given text. To derive emotion
scores from text, IBM uses a stacked generalisation-based ensemble
framework to achieve greater predictive accuracy (Costa, Paul T,
1992). Features such as n-grams (unigrams, bigrams and trigrams),
punctuation, emoticons, curse words, greeting words (such as hello,
hi, and thanks), and sentiment polarity are fed into state-of-the
machine learning algorithms to classify emotion categories (Fellbaum,
2005).

Most of these prior works are based on the Linguistic Inquiry and Word
Count (LIWC) psycholinguistics dictionary (Tausczik \& Pennebaker,
2010), and (Pennebaker et al., 2007.) The LIWC is used to find
psychologically meaningful word categories from word usage in writing.


\section{Data Analysis \& Feature Extraction}

\subsection{Overview of the Data}

All interactions have been gathered and grouped by server status and
applied IBM Watson algorithm to fetch the emotion social tone for an
overview of the system behavior and user’s corresponding’s with
Facebook in same time. Figure~\ref{fig:emotiontone} shows the
relationship between the server behavior and emotions of the users, in
the system failed status shows significate difference in overall anger
in different status, furthermore, the Joy parameter shows a
significate difference in system working idle and failure status,
however fear and sadness parameters is almost the same even with the
system idle and working in stable stage.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\caption{Overall emotion tone response to server failure/idle status}
\label{fig:emotiontone} 
\end{figure}

Identifying user’s personality based on the Facebook interaction
analysis, by applying IBM Watson personality insight tool, by
gathering all comments from user. However, some user’s in the data set
had undertaken the BIG Five (44 questionnaire), in this case these
values have been used instead.

Second stage was grouping the comments based on server status and
segment these interactions by user, to investigate the impact of
server status in the emotion of the user and investigate the BIG Five
dimension as constant parameter.

Investigating the relationship between personality trait dimension and
the social emotion tones, to find the highest correlation to identify
the key elements of the potential model. Applying the linear
regression and Pearson correlation. Building a neural network
multilayer perception using the potential key elements with higher
correlations.

The previous overview encourages more investigation to understand the
relationship between user’s behavior and computer system
behavior’s. The data collected from the social media interactions have
been grouped by users and IBM Watson Personality Insights have been
used to identify BIG Five personality traits for each user. Using IBM
Watson Tone Analyzer, the data been grouped by user’s comments and
server status (failure, idle) to identify user’s social emotion tone
for each user. Table 2, shows sample of data used in the analysis,
while each row represents a separate user, each column represents BIG
5 traits, Social Emotion Tones and Server status. 

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

The aim of this paper is to model the user’s responsive behavior, one
of the approaches to build a conceptual framework model is to apply
linear regression in Investigating the relationship between BIG 5
personality dimensions and the emotion tones features.
